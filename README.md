## Hi there! I'm Roxana.
##### I'm Front End Development Student in [Laboratoria](https://github.com/Laboratoria) and a Visual Designer. I have a background in Art Direction that has led me to write thorough lines of code and to have one goal in mind: create aesthetically and functional digital products.
